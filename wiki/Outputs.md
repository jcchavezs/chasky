## dotenv

`dotenv` allows you to output credentials in an ephemeral `.env` file:

```bash
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
```

To configure it you need to get the secret from any of the supported sources and
fill the required values:

```yaml
- output: dotenv
  values:
    S3_BUCKET:
      static:
        value: "YOURS3BUCKET"
      type: static

    SECRET_KEY:
      bash:
        command: op read op://Employee/S3_ACCESS/password
      type: bash
```

Once the environment gets closed, the ephemeral `.env` file will get deleted.

## env

`env` allows you to output credentials as env vars in your shell:

```bash
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
```

To configure it you need to get the secret from any of the supported sources and
fill the required values:

```yaml
- output: env
  values:
    S3_BUCKET:
      static:
        value: "YOURS3BUCKET"
      type: static

    SECRET_KEY:
      bash:
        command: op read op://Employee/S3_ACCESS/password
      type: bash
```

## gcloud

`dotevn` allows you to output credentials in an ephemeral `application_default_credentials.json` file:

```json
{
  "client_id": "...",
  "client_secret": "...",
  "quota_project_id": "your google project",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "type": "authorized_user"
}
```

To configure it you need to get the secret from any of the supported sources and
fill the required values:

```yaml
- output: dotenv
  values:
    client_id:
      static:
        value: "YOURS3BUCKET"
      type: static

    client_secret:
      bash:
        command: op read op://Employee/GCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET/password
      type: bash
    
    ...
```

It will create an ephemeral .netrc file and keep it in the `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var which `gcloud` cli tool will
directly read.

Once the environment gets closed, the ephemeral `application_default_credentials.json` file will get deleted.

## netrc

`netrc` allows you to output credentials in the `.netrc` file format:

```netrc
machine api.github.com login jcchavezs password gho_I2d3DoDZxxxxxxxxxxvBmqL4un1pLZ30ERXU
```

To configure it you need to get the secret from any of the supported sources and
fill the required values:

```yaml
- output: netrc
  values:
    machine:
      static:
        value: "api.github.com"
      type: static

    login:
      bash:
        command: "gh api /user | jq .login"
      type: bash

    password:
      bash:
        command: "gh auth token"
      type: bash
```

It will create an ephemeral .netrc file and keep it in the `$NETRC_FILE` env var to be used like:

```bash
$ curl --netrc-file $NETRC_FILE ....
```

Once the environment gets closed, the ephemeral `.netrc` file will get deleted.
