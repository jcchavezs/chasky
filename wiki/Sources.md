## bash

`bash` is a common source, it allows you to declare how to generate the value
using a bash command. For example:

```yaml
GITHUB_TOKEN:
  type: bash
  bash:
    command: gh auth token
```

It is useful to obtain/generate secrets using CLI tools.

## keyring

`keyring` allows to access variables from the keyring system. It supports OS X, Linux/BSD (dbus) and Windows.

```yaml
my_value:
  type: keyring
  keyring:
    key: "my_key"
```

## static

`static` is the simples source, it allows you to specify the value literally:

```yaml
my_value:
  type: static
  static:
    value: "josecarlos-chavez_atko"
```

It is useful to specify `variables`, values that are not secrets but still relevant as credentials, for example the user e-mail. It is also useful for testing purposes.
